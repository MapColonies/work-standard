# Map Colonies typescript service template

This is a basic template for building new map colonies services in typescript.

### template features:

- map-colonies "work-standard" prettier configuration.
- map-colonies typescript eslint configuration.
- docker file and map-colonies probe for containerization.
- dependency injection
- map-colonies logger and basic logging code:
  - basic global error handler middleware
  - incoming requests logging middleware
  - startup logs

### usage:

1. copy the template files to new service repository.
1. run `npm install `.
1. run `npm rebuild husky` to configure commit messages linting.
1. add the required logic for the new service:
   - to add new routes: create an express router and connect it to express server in ServerBuilder registerControllers function. when adding handler to the router make sure to add "validate" middleware from 'openapi-validator-middleware' for request validation.
   - modify the global error handler in the middleware folder to return better error responses and catch the errors before the global handler (currently it returns empty 500 response )

### usage notes:

1. when importing external dependencies from DI (such as McLogger) in class constructor the following decorator must be used to retrieve instance:

```typescript
@inject(delay(() => <injection token>)) <variable definition>
```

usage example:

```typescript
public constructor(
    @inject(delay(() => MCLogger)) private readonly logger: MCLogger) {
  }
```
